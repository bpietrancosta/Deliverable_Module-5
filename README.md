# Deliverable_Module-5
## The purpose of this analysis is to provide specific actionable recommendations to Pyber CEO

### Weekly fares by city type from January to April 2019:

### From the above chart we can make 2 primary observations:
### 1) **Urban environments see the greatest amount of money spent on fares, followed by Suburban and lastly Rural.**
### 2) Each city type has a relatively narrow range of values. They never intersect with one another.
###
### Market data per city type:
### [Summary dataframe.csv](https://github.com/bpietrancosta/Deliverable_Module-5/files/9976228/Summary.dataframe.csv)
### From the above we can make 4 key observations:
### 1) The ride count in each city type is greater than the previous by a multiple: Urban / Suburban > 2 and Suburban / Rural = 5.
### 2) The driver count in each city type is greater than the previous by a multiple: Urban / Suburban > ~ 5 and Suburban / Rural > 6.
### 3) The average fare per driver is inversely correlated to the values above. In Urban environments drivers make ~ $5 less than in Suburban environments and the latter group makes ~ $4 less than in Rural environments.
### 4) The revenue provided each sector in descending order is Urban, Suburban and Rural.


### On the basis of the above we can make suggestions to Pyber's CEO. See below:
### 1) In the Suburban and Rural sector the quantity of drivers is lesser than the quantity of rides. Incentives to add drivers in those sectors can help equalize supply and demand.
### 2) In the Urban sector the reverse is true. Driver quantity exceeds ride quantity. Therefore, you could help equalize supply and demand through incentivizing drivers to go into other sectors.
### 3) The most important recommendation however, is to do significant additional research on the following topics:
### a. Impact of driver count on ride wait time
### b. Impact of wait time on number of rides
### c. Average drive length per sector
### d. Mean cost to the company per driver per sector
### e. Definition of ride price structure as a function of sector and ride length
### From the above you'll be able to identify what drives your profitability for any given ride. Is it having a higher 'mean fare per driver'? Or is it just maximizing the number of rides? If drivers represent a trivial cost to the company, wait time is a key factor in attracting riders and marginal profitability is maintained, then the number of drivers does not concern the company.
